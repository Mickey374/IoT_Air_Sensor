Clone the project into the examples directory of the Contiki-NG directory.
  git clone <project_URL> contiki_ng/examples/

Open the Cooja software by navigating to the tools/cooja directory and run it using:
  cd contiki_ng/tools/cooja
  ant run

For building the Java collector, navigate to the AirSensorApp directory and execute the following commands to generate and run the JAR file:
  cd contiki_ng/examples/AirSensorApp
  mvn clean install
  java -jar target/GreenHouseApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

  sudo rm -r target/ // If you want to remove the target directory

In the Cooja environment, import the AirSensor.csc file. Reconfigure if possible by selecting the paths into the CoAP, MQTT, and RPL_Border_Router directories.

Ensure the creation of the 'sensors' database with tables named 'mqtt_temperature' and 'mqtt_humidity'.

Start listening to the server port on Cooja at 60001. Open another terminal and execute the following:

cd contiki_ng/examples/IoT_Air_Sensor/rpl-border-router/
make TARGET=cooja connect-router-cooja
This command ensures that the program listens and connects at port 60001 for the Border Router.

To view the payload generated by the MQTT application, execute the following command in a separate terminal:
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "#"
